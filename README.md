# integrator-ui

Only minor configuration is needed to get this project to run.

Please duplicate the `.env.sample` file locally and rename the copy to `.env`.

This UI project can be configured to either run against a local instance of the integrator.io API, 
or directly hit staging/prod APIs. By default, the .env file is setup to run against the Staging 
environment (api.staging.integrator.io). Simply by changing the API endpoint, you can
target a different environment. No other configuration is needed. Happy coding!
