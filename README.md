# integrator-ui

Only minor configuration is needed to get this project to run.

Please duplicate the `.env.sample` file and call the new copy `.env`.

This UI project can either be configured to run against a local instance of our API, or directly hit staging/prod APIs. By default, the .env file is setup to run against the Staging environments. Simply by changing the API endpoint, you can
target a different environment. No other configuration is needed.
