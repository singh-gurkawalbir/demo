  'Templates can be used to package up an integration running in your integrator.io account into a zip file, and then that template zip file can be shared with any other integrator.io user so that they can install a copy of the integration in their account (i.e. to possibly jump start the implementation for a common integration solution). IMPORTANT: the template zip files that you generate will never include your credential data, and when a template zip file is installed by another user they will always be re-prompted to provide their own credentials for all the connection records in the package.';
