  exports: `Exports are used to extract data from an application. 
    You can create and configure exports here or when you are building your flow. 
    You can even invoke a stand-alone export using the integrator.io API to pull data 
    in real-time into your own app.`,
  imports: `Imports are used to insert data into an application. You can create and 
    configure exports here or when you are building your flow. You can even invoke a 
    stand-alone import using the integrator.io API to insert data in real-time into an 
    application from your own app.`,
  agents: `Agents are small applications that you can install on your computers to 
    connect to data that is behind your firewall if you don't want to whitelist 
    integrator.io's IP addresses. Each agent has an access token associated with it 
    that should be used when installing the software on your computer. The installed
     agents connect to integrator.io and establish a reverse SSH tunnel allowing 
     secure communication through your firewall without any need of whitelisting 
     IPs in your firewall settings.`,
  connections: `Connections store credentials and other information needed to 
    access an application via its API. When you share an integration with other 
    integrator.io users, they are able to create, edit, or run a flow using the 
    connection resource that you specified within the shared integration. <br />

  recycleBin: `All deleted items will be kept in the Recycle bin for up to 30 days 
    before being automatically purged. All Flows in Recycle bin are deactivated and 
    will no longer run. You can restore any of the items listed in Recycle bin, or 
    purge them manually via Actions.`,
  scripts: `You can write scripts in JavaScript to customize your integrations, 
    enabling you to implement hooks, filters, transforms, and more. You can organize 
    your scripts however you’d like, such as having just one script record with all 
    of your code or splitting your code across multiple script records, even if 
    different users are responsible for them. Scripts can be used by any number of 
    resources in your integrator.io account, so use caution when modifying a script.`,
  stacks: `You can use stacks to host code for hooks, wrappers, connector installers 
    and settings pages. Stacks are simple server environments which can be implemented 
    in any coding language and are always invoked via HTTP. Every stack is assigned 
    a system token that should be used to authenticate HTTP requests. You own the IP 
    for all of your stacks, and can optionally choose to share a stack with other 
    integrator.io users.`,
  templates: `
    This is a special page enabled only for select partners. 
    Please use this page to publish templates to the integration marketplace. 
    You can also use this page to do all the standard template functionality 
    (i.e. install new integration, generate template zip file, etc...).`,
  connectors: `
    Integration apps represent fully functional pre-built integrations that any 
    user can install into their Integrator account, directly from the 
    Integrator Marketplace. Integration apps include an installer, uninstaller, 
    and a settings interface. Integration App developers can push updates 
    at any time for their Integration App to their entire install base. 
    A Integration App can create any number of components in a user's account.`,
  licenses: `
    From this page you can provision and also manage license records 
    for your Integration App product. License records control who can install 
    a new instance of your Integration App, and also when that instance should expire. 
    You can also create multiple license records for the same user to enable 
    multiple installs in their account (i.e. for parallel environments like 
    sandbox and production). The license data here is also available 
    via the integrator.io API, and you can use the API to sync this data 
    with your subscription and billing software to fully automate a 
    provisioning process.`,
  accesstokens: `
    API tokens are required to access the integrator.io API, which can be used 
    to perform CRUD operations on any resource in your account, or to synchronously 
    get data in and out of any application that integrator.io can connect with.
    API tokens can be provisioned with full or minimal access. API tokens can be
    revoked or reactivated at any time. Tokens can be regenerated 
    (as a security best practice to rotate the secret keys being stored externally).
    
    IMPORTANT: it may take up to one minute for API token changes to propagate 
    and take effect.`,

  apis: 'My APIs are custom HTTP endpoints built directly in integrator.io.  These APIs are powered by script functions that have full access to the integrator.io API.  Within your script logic, you can support any content-type (i.e. JSON, XML, etc…), any HTTP request method (GET, PUT, POST, etc…), and you can invoke any number of external APIs.  To provision access to your custom APIs, simply create one or more integrator.io API tokens.',
