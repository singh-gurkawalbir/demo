# CeligoTruncate

In this case, the text is short enough to fit into it's container and no
tooltip should be activated.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Short text">
    <Typography>
      <CeligoTruncate>This is short text</CeligoTruncate>
    </Typography>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

If the text is too long to fit within the bounding box, the text is
truncated with an ellisis. Also a tooltip will reveal the full text.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Truncated text">
    <Typography>
      <CeligoTruncate>
        This is really long text that will get truncated.
      </CeligoTruncate>
    </Typography>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Customized ellipsis is possible with the `ellipsis` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Custom ellipsis">
    <Typography>
      <CeligoTruncate ellipsis=" (more)">
        This is really long text that will get truncated.
      </CeligoTruncate>
    </Typography>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

It is possible to place the truncated tooltip on any side of the bounding box
by setting the `placement` property to one of the following values: [`bottom`, `top`, `left`, `right`] 

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Bottom tooltip placement">
    <Typography>
      <CeligoTruncate placement="bottom">
        Bottom Placement: This is really long text that will get truncated.
      </CeligoTruncate>
    </Typography>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Top tooltip placement">
    <Typography>
      <CeligoTruncate placement="top">
        Top Placement: This is really long text that will get truncated.
      </CeligoTruncate>
    </Typography>
  </Story>
   <Story name="Right tooltip placement">
    <Typography>
      <CeligoTruncate placement="right">
        Right Placement: This is really long text that will get truncated.
      </CeligoTruncate>
    </Typography>
  </Story>
  <Story name="Left tooltip placement">
    <Typography>
      <CeligoTruncate placement="left">
        Left Placement: This is really long text that will get truncated.
      </CeligoTruncate>
    </Typography>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
